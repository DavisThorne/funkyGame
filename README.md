# funkyGame

This is just a game im making in my spare time, its a text based RPG style game, im not sure where to take this, just wokring on it as i get the time too
I've imposed myself a limitation to try and use only inbuilt python libraries for this game to make it as universal as possible (it hopefully will run on all system types)
